                Our <button style="background-color: yellow; border: #fff; border-radius: 8px;"> <b style="padding: 10px;">aim is to make</b></button>  Suzuran the biggest internet community in the world. The most important point of our aim is to create a common workspace wherever in the world you are, unlike other communities with weak bonds between their members. Keep in mind that Suzuran has purposes more than a project. There is a suitable role for everybody under Suzuran since it needs you, no matter what you work with. We are working for empowering the projects that are not able to make their ideas real and get the projects released under us.
                <br><br>
                We are ready to provide every opportunity to create working conditions that will eliminate the importance of where you are in the world. In this project, we want to work and improve together with you. We aim to expand our world map with our new staff and colleagues by starting recruitments in a short time.
                <br><br>
                Suzuran is a universe created with a great background. Introducing this universe to the whole world and having pleasant moments will be one of our most important aims. For this purpose, we are planning to continue our lore explanations in 2 ways that can be listed as comics and animation series. We want to proceed with them in separate timelines. We want the story told by the comic book and the animation to pass in different time periods and we want people to understand the complete story at the end by merging them. 
                <br><br>
                We aim to produce a roguelike game that most gamers love in the gaming community. Even though it looks the same every time you play, we are hoping to create a work that will not bore you and will make you play it over and over again. We want to eradicate this game genre by taking advantage of the Suzuran's large universe. Via getting inspired by the Dead Cells and the Hades, which are masterpieces of this genre, we aim to present our own creations to you on Steam. The reason we want to present it on Steam is to destroy the influence created by other projects in the game world which is the logic of playing games by earning tokens and to show people what other things can be done.

                    Our main purpose in this project is to produce NFTs with Acquired Rarity System (ARS). What we aim here is to remove the current rarity system of NFTs, add new items and rarities to everyone's own NFT, and improve the initial NFTs that can be boring after a time with new and nice-looking ones. That's why we named the Acquired Rarity System the second phase. We wanted to give the right to participate in this phase to people who have a Suzuran Ticket. ARS will work with the help of tasks, and if we need to give examples of these tasks, we would like to explain them as two main assignments. First, earning Steam achievements is important for a gamer, taking this as a rule, a few certain achievements will be added and when these achievements are earned, they will trigger the ARS. Secondly, you will be entitled to participate in the festivals we are hosting and you can receive the ARS’ hidden in some of the special Suzuran events at the festivals. The main purpose of giving these two particular examples is to show that instead of sticking to a single task type, ARS distributes multiple tasks, allowing everyone to concentrate on their own taste while it also helps all participants to work under equal conditions.

                    Music is one of the values we believe in. In our opinion, music, in other words, sound, is a form of expression that has existed since the first day of humanity. We strongly support this fact and we want to improve the music in everything we do as well as wanting to offer you beautiful sounds that you will listen to with passion. In particular, our biggest goal in this regard is to organize a live opera that will be broadcast all over the world at the same time.

                    Since we do not like the current fashion very much, we think we can evolve it into a more aesthetic way. With a more chaotic, asymmetrical, and unique fashion approach, we hope to form collaborations with big brands and create a style that is open for innovations in this direction. We want to do the first Europe NFT fashion show with this new style. We want the eyes of the whole world to be on our designs at that moment.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the things we want to do is festivals that will be held in the name of Suzuran. We want to surprise all humanity with our innovative and futuristic plans in this regard. Wouldn't you want to be a part of the first NFT festival and spend all your time enjoying this innovative festival?
